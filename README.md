# labrea-simple
Fun version of labrea in python that doesn't actually replace labrea...

Run this program and it starts a TCP listener on every port it can between 1000 - 65535. Not so useful (or very useful depending on who you are), but it makes port scans light up like Christmas tree.

This Python implementation of part of Labrea is a resource hog and probably not useful. I wrote it years ago and though I'd look at it again. I found some stuff that no longer worked so I updated it to use asyncio.
